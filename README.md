# Quake Report App

This app displays a list of recent earthquakes in the world from the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) organization. 
I learned to build this app in a Udacity course (Android Basics: Networking).

More info on the USGS Earthquake API available at: https://earthquake.usgs.gov/fdsnws/event/1/

The data is fetched from the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) organization.
The fetched data is displayed in the app.
